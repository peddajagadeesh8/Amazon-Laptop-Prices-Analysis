### Introduction

Welcome to our project on analyzing laptop prices on Amazon! In this project, we're diving into the fascinating world of online shopping to understand how prices for laptops vary on one of the largest e-commerce platforms, Amazon.

### Objective

Our goal is to explore the different factors that influence laptop prices on Amazon and provide insights that can help consumers make informed decisions when purchasing a laptop.

### Why It Matters

In today's digital age, laptops have become essential tools for work, education, and entertainment. However, with the multitude of options available, it can be challenging to determine which laptop offers the best value for money. By analyzing laptop prices on Amazon, we aim to shed light on the pricing dynamics of this popular product category.

### Approach

We'll begin by collecting data from Amazon, including information about various laptop models, their prices, and other relevant details. Next, we'll clean and preprocess the data to ensure its accuracy and consistency. Then, we'll delve into exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
